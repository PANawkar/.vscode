//Subarray
//Continuous part of array
//1 3 0 7 2 0 2 this is an array
//1         0 2 
//  3 0 7 2  this is an subarray
//Number of subarrays of an array with n elements= nC2+n=n*(n+1)/2



//Subsequence
//A Subsrquence is a sequence that can be derived an array by selecting zero or more elements without 
//changing the order of the remaining elements.
//1 3 0 7 2 0 2 this is an array
//1   0     0 2
//   2 7 2       this is an subsequence



//(Every Subarray is a Subsequence but every Subsequence is not a Subarray)
